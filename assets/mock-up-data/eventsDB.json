With hilarious consequences, one character’s entrance to House (in the theatre) is another’s exit from Garden (in the studio), in this fast-paced duo of plays!\n\nWith a marriage collapsing inside and a fête being arranged outside, Alan Ayckbourn’s signature witty and insightful writing is on full display.\n\nHouse and Garden's storyline can be enjoyed through the eyes of different characters in either of the two spaces. Both are full length plays and can be watched in either order and enjoyed singly or together. Ticket offers are available if you purchase tickets for both plays and there are limited opportunities to catch them both on the same day. Early booking is advised. Don’t miss this comic experiment with time and space from a master of British theatre."

With hilarious consequences, one character’s entrance to House (in the theatre) is another’s exit from Garden (in the studio), in this fast-paced duo of plays!\n\nWith a marriage collapsing inside and a fête being arranged outside, Alan Ayckbourn’s signature witty and insightful writing is on full display.\n\nHouse and Garden's storyline can be enjoyed through the eyes of different characters in either of the two spaces. Both are full length plays and can be watched in either order and enjoyed singly or together. Ticket offers are available if you purchase tickets for both plays and there are limited opportunities to catch them both on the same day. Early booking is advised. Don’t miss this comic experiment with time and space from a master of British theatre."

        "description": "From their rise to MTV superstardom through pop-punk’s modern resurgence, Simple Plan have been an indelible part of pop culture since forming in Montreal in 1999. They’ve sold 10 million albums worldwide, won multiple Juno Awards, performed at the 2010 Winter Olympics – and, most recently, launched the omnipresent #ImJustAKid TikTok challenge that’s spawned more than 3.4 million videos, including clips from Hilary Duff, Ed Sheeran, Usher and Venus and Serena Williams.\n\nBut most importantly, they’ve never lost connection with what really matters: their audience. “We feel so lucky to have fans who love our old and new material,” says drummer Chuck Comeau. “We’re very proud of our past, but we’re even more excited about the future. We truly always feel we’re 3 minutes away from the best or biggest song of our career.”\n\nTen years on from their 2002 debut, No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls, Simple plan returned in 2022 with their sixth studio album, Harder Than It Looks. The first self-released album from Comeau, vocalist Pierre Bouvier and guitarists Sébastien Lefebvre and Jeff Stinco, the album respected Simple Plan’s storied career while pushing them forward in new ways, with songs like 'The Antidote', 'Ruin My Life' (ft. Deryck Whibley), 'Congratulations', 'Wake Me Up (When This Nightmare’s Over)' and 'Iconic'."

Good observation is the key to unlocking your creativity and enhance your drawing skills. The course will guide you through fundamental principles and rules that will make your drawings and illustration recognisable and realistic. \r\n \r\nDrawing and illustration are two very similar things, but with some differences. Drawing is a form of self-expression whereas illustration is used to convey a message and to accompany a text, often in a commercial context. Either way, to draw or illustrate, you must learn the fundamentals of drawing first.\r\n\r\nStudents will learn classical drawing techniques and concepts, and some fundamentals about artistic expression and the course covers basic techniques including \r\n\r\n•\tdrawing transfer methods\r\n•\tpencil drawing textures\r\n•\ttypes of perspective\r\n•\tlight and shade\r\n•\ttonal values\r\n•\tlaws of composition\r\n•\tphotorealism\r\n\r\nThe course will also look at themes such as geometrical forms, landscape, flower, and plants the human figure and portraits. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, you start by copying other drawings which is a great method for beginners to help you develop an eye for detail and understand how to construct your artwork. \r\n\r\nYour tutor will guide you through step-by-step processes and provide live demonstrations, plus one to one support and additional materials such as handouts. Some of the exercises will be based on the drawings and methods from a book called ‘Drawing – a complete guide’ by Giovanni Civardi’. \r\n\r\nWho is this course for?\r\nThis course is suitable for adults aged 18+ years. It is suitable for beginners who have no experience drawing and want to learn all the basics, and for improvers who are looking to develop and refine their skills. \r\nThis course may be accessible for people with disabilities. The room is wheelchair accessible. A support worker or carer may assist; carers must book a complimentary ticket if attending to provide support.
